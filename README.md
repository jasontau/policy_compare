A Rails 5 application to quickly compare commercial insurance quotes from different companies. Data visualization with Chartkick.js library is used to show trends for various classes of business.

The user uploads insurance quotes in PDF form which are converted to CSV via a third-party API. This data is then parsed using a PostgreSQL database of insurance wordings and matched against a standardized list of Insurance Bureau of Canada coverages. This allows the user to quickly compare contracts with differing verbiage.
